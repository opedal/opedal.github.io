I am a PhD student at ETH Zurich, advised by [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://lre.inf.ethz.ch/), [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/), and [Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs), and supported by the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems](https://learning-systems.org/). I work on natural language processing, machine learning, and computational linguistics.

I am currently interested in problems related to deductive reasoning in language models, particularly as it relates to efficiency.  Some other topics of interest include: linguistic and cognitive evaluation of LLMs, understanding and modeling human reading, test-time adaptation/scaling, context-free parsing, and constrained generation of LLMs. 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained an MSc in Data Science from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and a BSc in Industrial Engineering from [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/). I have also spent time at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

I am always open to discuss ideas and techniques in my areas of interest, so feel free to reach out!
