I am a PhD student at ETH Zurich, advised by [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://www.mrinmaya.io/), [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/), and [Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs), and supported by the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems](https://learning-systems.org/). I work on natural language processing, machine learning, and computational linguistics.

I am particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms behind language processing and reasoning, both in language models (**interpretability**) and in the human mind (**cognitive modeling**). 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained an MSc in Data Science from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and a BSc in Industrial Engineering from [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/). I have also attended the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

I am always open to new collaborations on projects that interest me. Please do reach out!
