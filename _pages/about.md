I am a 2nd year PhD student at ETH Zurich, advised by [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/), [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://www.mrinmaya.io/), and [Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs), and supported by the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems](https://learning-systems.org/). I work on natural language processing and computational linguistics.

Currently, I am particularly interested in formalisms to represent linguistic structure and their related algorithms. I want to use such tools to understand the mechanisms behind language processing and reasoning, both in the human mind (**cognitive modeling**) and in language models (**interpretability**). 

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained an MSc in Data Science from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and a BSc in Industrial Engineering from [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/). I have also attended the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).

I am always open to new collaborations on projects that interest me. Please do reach out!
